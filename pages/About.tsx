    <h1>Our purpose</h1>
    <p>A future vision of what I am thinking about in our community is that each team will build their own portfolio to showcase their work. We will create a dedicated website for our community where we can display our services. There will be a dedicated digital marketing company to promote our work in a way that befits it. There are many implications for these ideas, but for now, it is just a future vision </p>
